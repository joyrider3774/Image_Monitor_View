Image_Monitor_View is a little tool to display GIF, PNG, BMP or JPG image fullscreen stretched, always on top on a certain monitor. I created it for my pinball cabinet to display backglass pictures using launch before script for pinballx while playing
certain games that do not have build in backglass support.

[Latest Release](https://github.com/joyrider3774/Image_Monitor_View/releases/latest)

## Parameters
The tool accepts 2 parameters the first one the 0 based monitor index  (so monitor 1 = 0 , 2 = 1 etc) to where the image should be displayed and the 2nd parameter the full path to a jpg, gif, png or bmp filename.

## Example usage
to display the image fullscreen on second monitor
Image_Monitor_View.exe 1 "C:\PinballX\Media\Malzbies Pinball Collection\Backglass Images\garden.png"
